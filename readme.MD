An app to manage daily meetings built using Swift and SwiftUI. The app uses visual and audio cues to indicate when and how long each attendee should speak. The app also displays a progress screen that shows the time remaining in the meeting and creates a transcript that users can refer to later. This project is part of the [iOS App Dev Tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training).
